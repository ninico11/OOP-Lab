# OOP-Lab
1. I installed Ubuntu via dual boot
2. I installed zsh and oh-my-zsh and chose the "radom" theme
3. I created a program in c file using the nano command and compiled it with the gcc and make commands
4. Using the terminal, I created a git repository and added all the necessary files and screenshots
